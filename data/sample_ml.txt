Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Predicts outcomes for new data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Works with unlabeled data
   - Finds hidden patterns
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learns through trial and error
   - Receives rewards or penalties
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics

Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Means Clustering

Applications:
Machine learning is used in recommendation systems, image recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles.

Getting Started:
To begin with machine learning, learn Python, understand statistics, study linear algebra, and practice with real datasets.
